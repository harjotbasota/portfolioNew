        <p>
            As a dedicated <span class="highlight">Software Developer</span> with a strong foundation in 
            <span class="highlight">web development</span>, <span class="highlight">cloud</span>, and 
            <span class="highlight">DevOps</span>, I bring both practical experience and a passion for 
            innovative solutions. Currently, I’m honing my skills at the 
            <span class="highlight">Chartered Institute of Marketing Management of Ontario (CIMMO)</span>, 
            where I tackle diverse challenges and contribute to tech-driven projects. In my role, I've 
            consistently delivered robust, scalable solutions, drawing on my expertise in full-stack 
            development, cloud, and automation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My technical journey includes successful deployments and projects that demonstrate my commitment 
            to quality and impact. Key projects like the <span class="highlight">Cloud Resume Challenge</span>, 
            an <span class="highlight">Inventory Management Application</span>, and a 
            <span class="highlight">Gold Screen Cinema website</span> reflect my proficiency in designing, 
            building, and deploying full-stack applications. Through these projects, I’ve developed a 
            versatile skill set, which spans <span class="highlight">front-end and back-end development</span> 
            as well as <span class="highlight">cloud infrastructure</span> and <span class="highlight">DevOps pipelines</span>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            With certifications such as <span class="highlight">AWS Certified SysOps Associate</span> and 
            <span class="highlight">Terraform Certified Associate</span>, I bring validated skills in 
            <span class="highlight">cloud infrastructure management</span> and <span class="highlight">automation</span>. 
            I'm deeply committed to continuous learning and thrive in fast-paced, problem-solving environments 
            where I can apply my technical knowledge and tackle complex challenges.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Looking forward, my goal is to further advance as a <span class="highlight">software developer</span> 
            with a focus on <span class="highlight">cloud</span> and <span class="highlight">DevOps technologies</span>. 
            I'm particularly interested in roles that allow me to contribute to efficient, resilient, and automated 
            solutions. Known for my <span class="highlight">hard-working approach</span> and readiness to take on 
            new challenges, I aim to add value through a combination of technical skills, attention to detail, and a 
            collaborative mindset.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and drive to an innovative team where I can 
            continue growing as a developer and contribute to impactful tech solutions.
